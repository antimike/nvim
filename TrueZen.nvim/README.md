# TL;DR

<div style="text-align: justify">
	TrueZen.nvim is a NeoVim plugin written in Lua that aims to provide a cleaner and less cluttered interface [than usual] when toggled in either of it's three different modes (Ataraxis, Minimalist and Focus). It can be installed with your favorite plugin manager and has some sane defaults so that you can just execute ':TZAtaraxis' to get started!

## Updating

This depends on your plugin manager. If, for example, you are using Packer.nvim, you can update it with this command:

```lua
:PackerUpdate
```

# ü§ñ Usage (commands)

All the commands follow the _camel casing_ naming convention and have the `TZ` prefix so that it's easy to remember that they are part of this plugin. These are all of them:

## Default

-   `:TZMinimalist` toggles Minimalist mode. Activates/deactivates NeoVim's UI components from the left, bottom and top of NeoVim on all the buffers you enter in the current session.
-   `:TZFocus` toggles Focus mode. Maximizes/minimizes the current window.
-   `:TZAtaraxis` toggles Ataraxis mode. Ataraxis is kind of a "super extension" of Minimalist mode that uses it for deactivating UI components, however, it also provides padding to all buffers in the current session + makes use of the different integrations. Furthermore, you could also set values for the padding of the left (`l`), right (`r`), top (`t`), and bottom (`b`) of the Ataraxis instance you are about to spawn. This values are optional and when given their equivalent from the config is ignored. They should be separated by spaces and the format they should have is: `<(l)eft/(r)ight>/(t)op/(b)ottom<number_of_cells>`. Here is an example:

```
:TZAtaraxis l10 r10 t3 b1
```

Note: it's not mandatory to give all four of them.

## UI Elements

-   `:TZBottom` toggles the bottom part of NeoVim's UI. It toggles: laststatus, ruler, showmode, showcmd, and cmdheight.
-   `:TZTop` toggles the top part of NeoVim's UI. It toggles: tabline.
-   `:TZLeft` toggles the left part of NeoVim's UI. It toggles: numbers, relative numbers, and signcolumn.

## On/Off

-   `:TZAtaraxisOn` turns on Ataraxis mode.
-   `:TZAtaraxisOff` turns off Ataraxis mode.
-   `:TZMinimalistOn` turns on Minimalist mode.
-   `:TZMinimalistOff` turns off Minimalist mode.
-   `:TZFocusOn` turns on Focus mode
-   `:TZFocusOff` turns off Focus mode

The following commands are enabled is the `ui_elements_commands` setting is set to true as well:

-   `:TZBottomOn` show bottom UI parts.
-   `:TZBottomOff` hide bottom UI parts.
-   `:TZTopOn` show top UI parts.
-   `:TZTopOff` hide top UI parts.
-   `:TZLeftOn` show left UI parts.
-   `:TZLeftOff` hide left UI parts

# üçâ Configuration

Although settings already have self-explanatory names, here is where you can find info about each one of them and their classifications!

## UI

These settings are part of the `ui = {}` table and control Nvim's UI when toggling either Minimalist or Ataraxis mode. Those settings have the exact same names they have in NeoVim, so there is no need to explain what they do. If you need help with any of them use `:help <setting_name>`. Note that every setting belongs to a table that represents the part of the UI they are part of, for example: the setting `showtabline` is part of the `top = {}` table because visually it's part of the top part of NeoVim.

## Modes

They are part of the `modes = {}` table and control the settings for the different modes TrueZen provides!

### Ataraxis

-   `left_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the left.
-   `right_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the right.
-   `top_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the top.
-   `bottom_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the bottom.
-   `auto_padding`: (Boolean) if true, it will ignore `left_padding` and `right_padding` and will set them for you.
-   `keep_default_fold_fillchars`: (Boolean) Keep default fold fillchars. Useful if you want the mouse to keep working.
-   `ideal_writing_area_width`: (Table) sets an ideal width for the writing area. It can receive up to 3 values (`{<int -> min_width>, <int -> max_width>, <str -> "min"/"max">}`) but only one is needed for it to work. Passing a `0` to the table disables it, anything grater than does the opposite. It simply ensures a writing area of the given size regardless of the ui's proportions where possible. If only `<min_width>` is passed, then that value is the ideal writing area. Useful for people with multiple monitors that **don't use a terminal multiplexer or resize it often**. If `<min_width>` and `<max_width>` are passed, it defines a range to pick the writing area from, where the first value is the minimum width it can have and the second value is the maximum. Useful for people with **terminal multiplexers/that resize the terminal a lot**. If `<min_width>`, `<max_width>` and `<"min"/"max">` are passed, the same as passing the two values will happen but it will try pick either the "max" or the "min" width where possible.
-   `affected_higroups`: (Table) receives highlight groups you want TrueZen to override. The `key` must be the name of the highlight group and the `value` is a boolean (`true` for overriding the highlight group and `false` to just ignore it).
-   `bg_configuration`: (Boolean) if true, allows TrueZen to interact with the user's background. Set it to false only if you are having problems with it. (Note: Refer to the FAQ about this)
-   `quit`: (String - "untoggle", "close", nil) changes the behaviour of the `quit` command while on Ataraxis mode. if "untoggle", quit will untoggle Ataraxis mode, but if set to "close" it will close the original window from where it was first called. To simply use quit as always set it to `nil`.
-   `ignore_floating_windows`: (Boolean) if true, will avoid restoring TrueZen's layout after exiting a floating window. If you use plugins that depend on floating windows that disappear/appear constantly (e.g. [lspsaga.nvim](https://github.com/glepnir/lspsaga.nvim)), then you are not gonna want TrueZen to be "closing" them all the time. However, if x plugin creates a floating window that you [usually] interact with once then this isn't needed.
-   `custom_bg` (Table): used for adding custom bg (or none) used by the paddings and for tranquilizing the given `hi groups`. It receives two value, where value one is the style, and value two is the background propery/colors. If value one is `"solid"` then it will set the given hex color (value two) (e.g. `custom_bg = {"solid", "#1a1d1e"}`). If value one is `"darken"` it will darken the padding by the given degree between 1 and 0.0 (value two), where `1` is the same as the background and `0.0` is the completly dark (e.g. `custom_bg = {"darken", 0.87}`). Finally, if the value one is `"none"` then it the given color (value two) will only be using for tranquilizing the `hi groups` (e.g. `custom_bg = {"none", ""}`).

used for setting a backgroups color if your colorscheme doesn't provide one already/you don't want to set one for Nvim as a whole but only for TrueZen.nvim. If you already have a BG color, leave the quotes empty. Refer to the FAQ about this.

### Focus

-   `margin_of_error`: (Integer > 1) adjusts MOE (margin of error). Less = more precision, however, it's recommended to keep the defaults, or at least a number >= 2. This only matters if `focus_method` is set to `"native"`.
-   `focus_method`: (String: "native"/"experimental") sets focusing method. `"native"` uses "vim's way" of focusing windows. The drawback of this method is that it tends to break if you resize the terminal. `"experimental"` is a new way of focusing windows that allows for free terminal resizing.

## Integrations

These settings are part of the `integrations = {}` table and can be used to enable or disable integrations.

-   `galaxyline`: (Boolean) if true, hides galaxyline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `feline`: (Boolean) if true, hides feline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `vim_airline`: (Boolean) if true, hides vim airline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `vim_powerline`: (Boolean) if true, hides vim powerline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `express_line`: (Boolean) if true, hides expressline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `lualine`: (Boolean) if true, hides lualine when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `tmux`: (Boolean) if true, hides Tmuxs' statusline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `gitgutter`: (Boolean) if true, disables Gitgutter when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `vim_signify`: (Boolean) if true, disables Vim Signify when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
-   `limelight`: (Boolean) if true, enables Limelight when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back off after exiting it.
-   `twilight`: (Boolean) if true, enables Twilight when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back off after exiting it.
-   `gitsigns`: (Boolean) if true, disables Gitsigns' elements when Ataraxis mode is on and enables them after exiting it.
-   `lightline`: (Boolean) if true, hides lightline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.

## Misc

-   `on_off_commands`: (Boolean) if true, enables [On/Off commands](#onoff).
-   `ui_elements_commands`: (Boolean) if true, enables [commands for the UI elements](#ui-elements).
-   `cursor_by_mode`: (Boolean) if true, changes the cursors' shape according to the current Vi mode. Useful for when the statuline and showmode are hidden so that one can easily identify the current mode.

## Events

Use them to execute code at certain events [described by the names they have]. These are the ones available:

| Mode       | Function Name              |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Focus      | before_mode_focus_on       |
| Focus      | after_mode_focus_on        |
| Focus      | before_mode_focus_off      |
| Focus      | after_mode_focus_off       |
| Minimalist | before_mode_minimalist_on  |
| Minimalist | after_mode_minimalist_on   |
| Minimalist | before_mode_minimalist_off |
| Minimalist | after_mode_minimalist_off  |
| Ataraxis   | before_mode_ataraxis_on    |
| Ataraxis   | after_mode_ataraxis_on     |
| Ataraxis   | before_mode_ataraxis_off   |
| Ataraxis   | after_mode_ataraxis_off    |

They can be used like so:

```lua
local true_zen = require("true-zen")

true_zen.after_mode_ataraxis_on = function ()
	print("hi!")
end
```

# üßª Key-bindings

There are no default key-bindings. However, you can set them on your own as you'd normally do! Here is an example mapping `<F12>` to toggle `Ataraxis` mode:

**For init.lua**

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<F12>", [[<Cmd>TZAtaraxis<CR>]], opt)
```

**For init.vim**

```vimscript
map <F12> :TZAtaraxis<CR>
```

# üôã FAQ

-   A: Easy! Just copy and paste this:

For **init.lua**:

```lua
vim.cmd("autocmd VimEnter * TZAtaraxis")
```

For **init.vim**:

```vimscript
autocmd VimEnter * TZAtaraxis
```

-   Q: **_"How can I view the doc from NeoVim?"_**
-   A: Use `:help TrueZen.nvim`

-   Q: **_"Why isn't my statusline being hidden when I toggle Ataraxis mode?"_**
-   A: If your statusline does not have an integration, TrueZen will try its best to hide it. If it fails, then open an issue and request for the integration, and in the mean time use the built-in [events](#events).

-   Q: **_Getting this error: `E420: BG color unknown`. How do I solve this?_**
-   A: This issue occurs because:

1. You don't have `set termguicolors` in your init.vim (or `vim.cmd("set termguicolors")` in your init.lua). If that didn't help, use the `custom_bg` setting to set a bg color for TrueZen, this solution _should_ deffinately work. This will set a bg for TrueZen to use. If possible try to set it to match your normal Nvim background color.

and/or

2. Your current colorscheme doesn't provide a background (bg) color. To test the latter, run this command: `highlight StatusLineNC ctermfg=bg ctermbg=bg guibg=bg guifg=bg`. If you get an error, you can follow the above case's intructions to set it only for TrueZen or you could add the _hi_ so that it'll affect nvim as a whole:

```
hi NORMAL guibg=<color/hex_code>
" e.g.:
" hi NORMAL guibg=#1e222a
```

If you don't fit in either of the above cases/the fixes didn't work for you, then disable BG interaction between TrueZen and NeoVim (your colorscheme in this case) with the `disable_bg_configuration` setting under the `ataraxis = {}` table.

If you already tried everything of the above and _nothing worked_ (which I doubt), then it's an issue with your Colorscheme, not a TrueZen.nvim one!
