# üì¶ Installation

## Prerequisites

- [NeoVim nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) (>=v0.5.0)
- A nice color scheme to complement your experience ;)

## Adding the plugin
You can use your favorite plugin manager for this. Here are some examples with the most popular ones:

### Vim-plug

```lua
Plug 'Pocco81/HighStr.nvim'
```
### Packer.nvim

```lua
use "Pocco81/HighStr.nvim"
```

### Vundle

```lua
Plugin 'Pocco81/HighStr.nvim'
```

### NeoBundle
```lua
NeoBundleFetch 'Pocco81/HighStr.nvim'
```

## Setup (configuration)
As it's stated in the TL;DR, there are already some sane defaults that you may like, however you can change them to match your taste. These are the defaults:
```lua
verbosity = 0,
saving_path = "/tmp/highstr/",
highlight_colors = {
	color_0 = {"#0c0d0e", "smart"},	-- Cosmic charcoal
	color_1 = {"#e5c07b", "smart"},	-- Pastel yellow
	color_2 = {"#7FFFD4", "smart"},	-- Aqua menthe
	color_3 = {"#8A2BE2", "smart"},	-- Proton purple
	color_4 = {"#FF4500", "smart"},	-- Orange red
	color_5 = {"#008000", "smart"},	-- Office green
	color_6 = {"#0000FF", "smart"},	-- Just blue
	color_7 = {"#FFC0CB", "smart"},	-- Blush pink
	color_8 = {"#FFF9E3", "smart"},	-- Cosmic latte
	color_9 = {"#7d5c34", "smart"},	-- Fallow brown
}
```

The way you setup the settings on your config varies on whether you are using vimL for this or Lua.

## Updating
This depends on your plugin manager. If, for example, you are using Packer.nvim, you can update it with this command:
```lua
:PackerUpdate
```

# ü§ñ Usage (commands)
All the commands follow the *camel casing* naming convention and have the `HS` prefix so that it's easy to remember that they are part of the HighStr.nvim plugin. These are all of them:

## Default
+ `:HSHighlight <integer>`: highlights current visual selection and receives an `<integer>` that indicates which colors to use from the `highlight_colors = {}` table; if none is given, HighStr.nvim will pick `color_1`.
+ `:HSRmHighlight <rm_all>`: If the `rm_all` argument is given, removes all the highlighting in the current buffer. If not, does the same but for every line in visual selection.
+ `:HSExport`: exports highlights from the current session to `<saving_path>`. This command overrides previously saved highlights, so you may also use it for **clearing** them.
+ `:HSImport`: imports highlights from `<saving_path>`.

# üê¨ Configuration
Although settings already have self-explanatory names, here is where you can find info about each one of them and their classifications! 

## General
This settings are unrelated to any group and are independent.
- `verbosity`: (Integer) if greater that zero, enables verbose output (print what it does when you execute any of the two command).
- `saving_path`: (String) path to a directory for saving the highlights when they get exported. The directory shouldn't necessarily exist, however, the only condition is that it must end with a forward slash the path you give (`/`).

## Highlight Colors
The table `highlight_colors = {}` contains all of the colors HighStr.nvim will use when you highlight something. The convention is simple: `color_<a_number>`. Each color is a table in which the first element represents the background of the color (the highlight it self), and the second one represents the foreground (the color of the text that's being highlighted). The second parameter may also be the word "smart", to change the color of the foreground based on the background in order to get a better contrast (e.g. if background is white, set foreground to black). Here is an example:

```
color_1 = {"#FFF9E3", "smart"}
```

Here we are setting a cool color called Cosmic Latte (looks like white), that we are assigning to `color_1` and we are giving its parameters to a table: the first one is the highlight itself ("#FFF9E3") and in the second one ("smart") we are telling it to set a foreground that will make contrast with the background (black in this case).

Conditions:
- The numbers that are assigned to the colors (e.g. `color_2`) should not be repeated, because it's what you'll use to "call" that highlight color.
- The color it self (argument one in a color's table) should be in its hex value.

# üßª Key-bindings
There are no default key-bindings. However, you can set them on your own as you'd normally do! Here is an example mapping `<F3>` to highlight stuff and `<F4>` to remove the highlighting:

**For init.lua**
```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
    "v",
    "<F3>",
    ":<c-u>HSHighlight 1<CR>",
    {
        noremap = true,
        silent = true
    }
)

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
    "v",
    "<F4>",
    ":<c-u>HSRmHighlight<CR>",
    {
        noremap = true,
        silent = true
    }
)
```

**For init.vim**
```vimscript
vnoremap <silent> <f3> :<c-u>HSHighlight 1<CR>
vnoremap <silent> <f4> :<c-u>HSRmHighlight<CR>

```

# üôã FAQ

- Q: ***"What if I repeat a color's number?"***
- A: There would a conflict when calling `:HSHighlight`, however it will try and call any of those colors.

- Q: ***"How can I view the doc from NeoVim?"***
- A: Use `:help HighStr.nvim`


# ü´Ç Contribute

Pull Requests are welcomed as long as they are properly justified and there are no conflicts. If your PR has something to do with the README or in general related with the documentation, I'll gladly merge it! Also, when writing code for the project **you must** use the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/Pocco81/HighStr.nvim/blob/main/.editorconfig) file on your editor so as to "maintain consistent coding styles".
